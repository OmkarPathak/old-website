# Password Strength Evaluator Using Machine Learning
What is the project all about?

- Main aim of the project is to learn how the SVM (Support Vector Machines) algorithm work
- I didn't get a suitable dataset, and hence I created it by myself
- User just have to enter the password and based on the dataset created, SVM will classify the user data into password strengths.


## Technologies Used
* Flask (Python web development framework)
* SVM (Support Vector Machines) used for training and classification purposes
* Self-generated data set of 50000 instances
