  Hey there! Welcome to my small space on the web. I am Omkar Pathak, a computer geek and a Python aficionado. I love to code. Huge fan of open source software and an active contributor on GitHub. Other than programming, I love to sketch and read Agatha Christie's novels. When I am not coding, you can find me on Quora and Medium. I have also started taking an active interest in <a href="/photography/">photography</a> lately.

<!-- <p class="message scroll-effect" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> -->
My passion is creating full stack web applications while my interest lies in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am huge fan of Python language and love to give back to the Python community by making some useful projects.
<!-- </p> -->

In high school and college, I was the kid that seemed to never pay attention. I hated attending lectures. But on the same page, I love to learn and explore new technologies. I am very keen in applying my knowledge to practical use cases and creating a few projects using them.

You can see all my projects [here](/projects/). I always strive to write concise and effective code. Most of my projects are open-sourced and come with MIT/GPL3 license. You are free to modify the source code and free to use as you want.

Apart from programming I also love to travel. Lush green serene places excite me to a greater extent. Experiencing new places and eating various cuisines is the favourite part of my life!

<!-- Take an example of this website, my [previous website](old-website.omkarpathak.in) was built upon PHP and then I came to know about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll helped me create fabulous websites with faster load speeds and great ease. For personal websites and blogs, Jekyll is a great alternative to wordpress websites. -->
